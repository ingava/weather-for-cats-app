# weather-for-cats-app
This app shows weather according to the cat's location. Any cat can look at it and be informed about what to expect outside.

I've created this simple app as part of the Free Code Camp course. My goal here was to write the app in vanilla JavaScript and to learn
how to use promises. The app shows temperature according to the user's location as well as the main weather conditions such as rain, snow or sunny. The gif image updates accordingly. It is also possible to view temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
